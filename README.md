# Prep
This is a website where students in Botswana can have access to school resources online, its something that is not new but we are hoping it can bring about a change to how students are taught in Botswana.
Students from Primary all the way to senior school can have unlimited access to school material like books, test papers, notes and more all in one place. The website is meant to be very easy to use and access, free, beautiful, responsive and fast. More will be discussed as proudtion continues.
